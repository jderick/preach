Preach:

** preach doesnt' always succesfully createa a cex in non-localmode (even after the symmetry reduction/cex fix)

* in nonlocalmode, if an error happens the reported state count is 0

* preach doesn't print rules that fired in a counterexample


prun:

* Mark fixed them all!  

Makefile
* can't figure out how to get preach.beam to depend on common.erl

* really there should be two Makefiles, one to make preach and one to compile model.so (the latter can be symlinked from the run directory); right now Makefile serves both functions
