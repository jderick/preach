#
#  A test to see if all reachable states of german's protocol
#  can get to a state wherein all channels are empty and the
#  directory is not processing a command (CurCmd = Empty).
#  See the CGT property at the bottom of german.m for 
#  how this is expressed in our clunky syntax.  Also,
#  note the specification of the non-helpful rules to lgo
#  below via -nhr.  also note the use of -cm, which specifies
#  the size of the CGT hash table (which is distinct from
#  the reachable states hash table)
